# Weather-App-Frontend

The idea was to create a Weather App that uses current weather data. I started by searching for an API source. The most popular one I found is OpenWeatherMap, an online service that provides weather forecasts, nowcasts, and historical data in a fast and elegant manner. It took me a little time to figure out how to create an account and explore the current plans. I chose the Free Plan with 1,000,000 calls per month since I was just learning how to create an API. With this plan, I could access Current Weather, a 3-hour Forecast for 5 days, Air Pollution information, and Geocoding capabilities (Geocoding API is a service that takes a place as an address, latitude and longitude coordinates, or a place ID).

My next step was to select a tool for data validation and API testing, and I opted for Postman. Using Postman, I successfully implemented five GET requests, configured query parameters, and verified the data retrieved by the API. To retrieve this data, I used the JavaScript fetch() method and then called the response.json() method to parse the JSON data into a JavaScript object.
For styling, I utilized CSS and Material Symbols icons.
